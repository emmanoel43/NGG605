Frequentist Versus Bayesian Approaches

Exercise #1: If someone gets a positive test, is it "statistically significant" at the p<0.05 level? Why or why not?

The null hypothesis (H0) would be that the individual does not have the condition (e.g., HIV), and the alternative hypothesis (HA) would be that the individual does have the condition.

I do not think it is possible to deduce whether or not this positive test is statistically significant, as this assumes we know the population that the positive test is being compared to. In this case, the 5% false positive rate tells us the probability of a positive result given no HIV, but it doesnâ€™t directly tell us how statistically significant a single positive test is, because we lack information about the distribution of the data.
